= Contributing to LinuxCNC


== Introduction

This document describes the best practices for contributing code and
documentation updates to LinuxCNC.

If you are making modifications to the source, this document describes
an effective way for you to communicate these changes to the rest of
the developers on the project.  "Source" in this context means both
the source code to the programs and libraries, and the source text for
the documentation.


== Background

All of the source is maintained in the revision control system git
footnote:[http://git-scm.com/].  We have some instructions on how
to use git on our wiki, and some links to better git tutorials:
http://wiki.linuxcnc.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?Git

The official LinuxCNC git repo is at http://git.linuxcnc.org.

There is also a regularly updated git clone on github:
https://github.com/jepler/linuxcnc-mirror


== Overview of the process

The high-level overview of how to contribute changes to the source goes
like this:

* Communicate with the project developers and let us know what you're
  hacking on

* Clone the git repo

* Commit the changes you desire to a local branch

* Push your branch to a publicly visible git repo

* Communicate the location of your branch to the project developers


=== Communicating with the project developers

The two main ways that project developers communicate with each other are:

* Talk to us on IRC, at #linuxcnc-devel on FreeNode.

* Send email to the developers' mailing list:
  https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/emc-developers


== Other ways to contribute

There are many ways  to contribute to LinuxCNC, that are not addressed
by this document.  These ways include:

* Answering questions on the forum, mailing lists, and in IRC.

* Reporting bugs on the bug tracker, forum, mailing lists, or in IRC
